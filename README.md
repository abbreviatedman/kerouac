# Kerouac

A Visual Studio Code extension to encourage separation of writing and editing modes.

### Summary

Writers benefit from splitting their work into writing time and editing time. There is a productivity cost of switching to fiddling with the wording before enough is written. This extension allows the user to prevent themselves from giving into the temptation to fiddle until they decide that it's editing time.

### Feature Roadmap to 1.0

1. User can easily launch writing mode.
2. User gets a gentle confirmation before switching back to editing mode.
1. ~~In writing mode, user can't select text.~~
2. Iin writing mode, user can't delete text.
